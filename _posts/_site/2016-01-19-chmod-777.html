<h1 id="what-is-chmod-777">What is chmod 777?</h1>

<p>To make it easy to understand, we can break it into two parts.</p>

<p><u>chmod</u>: this command is meant to perform an action, which is to change the file permission.</p>

<p><u>777</u>: All three users (owner, group, public) can perform all three operations (read/write/execute) on a file.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>// computer only understands numbers.

No permission – 0
Execute – 1
Write – 2
Write and Execute – 3
Read – 4
Read and Execute – 5
Read and Write – 6
Read, Write, and Execute – 7
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>chmod 777, in other word that <u>7</u>(owner)<u>7</u>(group)<u>7</u>(public) have read, write, execute permission.</p>

<p>You can also use the -R (recursive) if your targeted folder has sub-folders. E.g. <u>chmod -R 777</u></p>
