### {{ page.title }}

Vue is a progressive framework for building user interface.

#### `CDN`

You can get the CDN from [Vue installation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html){:target="_blank"} and reference it in your application.

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.5.13/dist/vue.js"></script>

Remove the version `@2.5.13`, you'll always received the latest version.
